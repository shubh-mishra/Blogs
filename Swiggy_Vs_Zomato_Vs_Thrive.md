Introduction
During 2010s, we ordered food from home using one the pamphlets that restaurants had left at our doorsteps.
Around 2014-2015, Zomato and Swiggy entered the food delivery business. All we had to do was open their app, search the restaurant, select the food items and order it.
The food would get delivered to our house in 30 mins.

Issue with Zomato and Swiggy?
1. Very high commission charges, typically 25-30%. So the restaurants had to markup their charges.
2. The restaurants had no data/information about their customers. 

Thrive enters the market
Thrive is a technology company that has created a plotform where restaurants have complete control over their business (and data).
It has tie ups with the logistics companies for delivery.
The commission charged by Thrive is merely 3%

Issue with Thrive
1. If the delivery becomes late, who is to blame - the restaurant or the logistic company?
2. Restaurants tend to not update their menus. So when a customers order something, the next minute he gets a call saying the item is no longer available, would he like refund?
3. When the restaurants get hold of the customer data, they spam quite a lot more. Like the D2C companies spamming our whatsapp chats.

Then why did Coca-Cola invested in 15% of Thrive?
1. Cola-Cola wants to package its products with food orders.
2. Average order value of direct orders (Rs 800-900) is lot more than those of discovery-led orders (Rs 250-300).
3. Thrive has only tech costs. Its not spending on ads or logistics. Which means there is a high chance of it being profitable)
